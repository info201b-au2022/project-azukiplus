## About the data

**The AGRI National Project**. The [Alberta Gambling Research Institute](https://research.ucalgary.ca/alberta-gambling-research-institute) provides data about gambling addiction. The data used for this project has been directly imported from the AGRI National Project, a longitudinal study about gambling addiction and habits. The files were originally from the [Greo Dataverse](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/JYUO8E&version=1.1).

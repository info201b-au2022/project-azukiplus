## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!

## ABOUT THIS FILE:

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Summary Tables

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Charts
```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/chart1.R")
bar
```
In order to determine whether gambling tendencies are correlated with drug and alcohol usage, we decided to make a chart to see the relationship
between gambling tendencies and drug usage. This chart is color encoded so the top portion of the stacked bar chart are people who always used drugs while they gambled, and the bottom portion of the stacked bar chart is people who never used drugs while they gambled. There seems to be a correlation between people who gamble more and drug usage. People with no debt from gambling, or those who gambled the least out of those surveyed, reported a significantly less amount of drug usage while they gambled, while the people who had more debt from gambling reported a larger drug usage.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

In order to determine whether personality has an effect on compulsive gamblers, we decided to see if there is a relationship between
gambling tendencies and impulsiveness. The measure for impulsiveness was taken from the [NEO Personality Index](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-14475-009). For the gambling survey, researchers put the "Impulsiveness" measure section of
the NEO index to measure a person's impulsiveness to see if there is a correlation between impulsiveness as a personality trait and 
tendencies to gamble. The chart above shows the amount of self-reported debt that each gambler has as well as their impulsiveness measured
on a scale of 0 points to 32 points, with 32 being the most impulsive and 0 being the least impulsive. This chart shows that while there 
maybe some small correlations between impulsiveness and tendencies to gamble, the correlation was likely small. The average peak of 
the frequencies of people in each gambling category was in a relatively similar impulsiveness scale, and even those who had more debt
still didn't report a significantly higher number on their scores for impulsiveness.

This chart shows Alcohol usage vs gambler debt. (We are a 3 person group, so this is just an extra graph for fun.)
